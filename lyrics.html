        <div id="lyrics">
        You're on the phone with your girlfriend<br>
She's upset<br>
She's going off about something that you said<br>
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do<br>
I'm in my room<br>
It's a typical Tuesday night<br>
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like<br>
And she'll never know your story like I do'<br><br>
But she wears short skirts<br>
I wear T-shirts<br>
She's cheer captain<br>
And I'm on the bleachers<br>
Dreaming about the day when you wake up<br>
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br><br>
If you can see I'm the one who understands you<br>
Been here all along so why can't you see<br>
You belong with me<br>
You belong with me<br><br>
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans<br>
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be<br>
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself<br>
Hey isn't this easy<br>
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town<br>
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down<br>
You say your fine<br>
I know you better then that<br>
Hey what you doing with a girl like that<br><br>
She wears high heels<br>
I wear sneakers<br>
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers<br>
Dreaming about the day when you wake up<br>
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br><br>
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you<br>
Been here all along so why can't you see<br>
You belong with me<br>
Standing by and waiting at your back door<br>
All this time how could you not know<br>
Baby, you belong with me<br>
You belong with me<br><br>
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night<br>
I'm the one who makes you laugh<br>
When you know you're about to cry<br>
And I know your favorite songs<br>
And you tell me about your dreams<br>
I think I know where you belong<br>
I think I know it's with me<br><br>
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you<br>
Been here all along so why can't you see<br>
You belong with me<br>
Standing by and waiting at your back door<br>
All this time<br>
How could you not know<br>
Baby you belong with me<br>
You belong with me<br><br>
You belong with me<br>
Have you ever thought just maybe<br>
You belong with me<br>
You belong with me<br>
